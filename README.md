# Rubicon-Red
Hi Sir ,before typing the coading i would like to express my idea on the given problem,i'am from Ece i had some  knowledge in java but not that extent.
First let me discuss the idea for finding the solution to this problem,as i had some good analytic skills.
let us now take a blue print of whole idea in simple steps.
first we need to store the the number of products ,product id ,product name and product price. 
Now store number of carts in the shop.
we have to write   product not found exception if we dont find our required product or if the product is finished or out of stock.
If there are limited number of carts in the shop and the number of shoppers are more than the carts available in the shop then the person without cart is not treated as shopper that means the maximum number of shoppers is equal to the number of carts 
when the product count becomes zero then that product should be deletd or a message should be displayed showing that the product is completed
When the cart is active that means some one is shopping so,the number of active carts at a particular time is equal  to the number of shoppers at a particular time
The details of shopper is choosen by us and it can be changed ,his shopping capacity is decided by us whether light shopper or heavy shopper 
If we give some inputs of person regarding the products then that sholud be minused from the whole quantity and the remaining should be stored,simultaneously what ever we are adding to the cart the price should be plused to get the total amount in the cart at a particular time
We have to develop some methods like add product,delete product ,cart status ,shelf status,product count in the cart,get cart price etc.
This is the whole idea i understood from the assignment
As we have busy continuous schedule in our college we are distracted,iam very much  intrested to work for Rubicon red hope so,u will understand will send the code as soon as possible
thank you sir
